        **Project Overview**
---------------------------------------
This Chess Game was developed as a school project. It features a functional chessboard, movement mechanics, and turn-based gameplay.

---------------------------------------
            **Features**
---------------------------------------
- A fully interactive chessboard with move validation.
- Turn indication for "White" and "Black."
- Castling logic.
- Highlighted possible moves.
- King check and checkmate detection.

---------------------------------------
          **Known Issues**
---------------------------------------
While the game is playable, minor bugs may still exist. These will be addressed as time permits.

---------------------------------------
      **Unfinished Features**
---------------------------------------
Several features are planned for future implementation:

    - Pawn Promotion: Adding the ability to promote a pawn upon reaching the end of the board.
    - En Passant: Implementing the special pawn capture rule.
    - Draw Conditions: Recognizing and handling stalemates, threefold repetition, and insufficient material scenarios.
    - Visual Enhancements:
        - Displaying captured pieces.
        - Showing the material balance to indicate which player is ahead.

These features are on hold due to upcoming exams. I plan to revisit and complete these functionalities when time allows.
